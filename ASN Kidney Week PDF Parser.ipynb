       "2  Of the 154 respondents, 58% were from the US, 53% were women, and \\nthe median age was between 41-45. The majority (77%) identified their practice setting \\nas academic. 55% of the respondents had fellowship training in women’s health, which \\nwas similar across country of training (p=0.325). Nephrologists from both countries lacked \\nconfidence across a spectrum of issues (Figure 1). Most provided contraception (64%) and \\npre-conception (68%) counseling to less than one woman per month though counseling \\noccurred significantly more frequently in the US. In their career, 91% have cared for less \\nthan five pregnant women on dialysis. Only 12% had access to interdisciplinary clinics. \\nFinally, 89% felt that interdisciplinary guidelines and/or continuing education seminars \\nwould improve knowledge.  \n",
